# Road-Severity-prediction

This project intend to predict the severity of road accident by considering attributes like whether, climate, atmospheric conditions, condition of vehicles, roads and other conditions among others.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avikumart/road-traffic-severity-classification

## Technologies used 
### Python, Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit etc.

## Setup
### Import the dataset from kaggle and get description of all the columns
### Find the missing values from the dataset
### Analyze  the dataset using python libraries
### Prepare the data for modeling
### Fill the missing values using different method of panda functions
### Covert columns using get dummies method
### Now develop a classification machine learning model using machine learning algorithms.
### Evaluate the model in Test Data
### Using Streamlit lib develop a web interface
